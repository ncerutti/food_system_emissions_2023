<center>This repository contains a summary of the recent trends in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the food system. It is also here to have a place to save some figures :)
<br>
A more detailed overview can be found, among others, in the paper _Food System Emissions: A Review of Trends, Drivers, and Policy Approaches, 1990–2018_, that I coauthored with William Lamb, Monica Crippa, Adrian Leip, Efisio Solazzo, Francesco Tubiello, and Jan Minx.

In the paper we summarize trends and drivers of global food system emissions from 1990 to 2018. We highlight regional diversity in patterns of food system emissions and identify the highest global emitters. While food system emissions have stabilized in some regions and countries, global emissions are increasing, with growth in certain sectors and countries outweighing the handful of cases where sustained emissions reductions have been achieved. Emissions from livestock rearing account for a large portion of global emissions, and the contribution of post-production emissions is steadily increasing in all regions.

Here, I present some insights that came from the analysis conducted in the paper and I conclude with a few concerns I have regarding mitigation in the sector.

If anything, the two main messages that I would like this table to convey are:

1.  the amount of CH₄ produced by the food system on the total.
2.  how much of it comes from land use and production
3.  how different the weight of food-related emissions is in each region

Next, I would like to quickly compare two of the most relevant sources and how they classify food system emissions: the EDGAR (dataset from the JRC) and the FAO data on emissions (whose category you can see under FAO classification). Part of what is considered land use in the first one is considered production in the second one, but as you can see the classification is mostly homogeneous. The main points we should focus here are:

1.  the huge amount of methane comes mostly from production, although it represents almost 100% of all the emissions from the waste stage
2.  carbon dioxide emissions are almost equally divided between emissions from energy use and from land use (deforestation plays here an important role)

Now, let us look at where these emissions happen and which gases. In the paper the analysis focuses on other aspects (I do not think this figure is in there). Here, however, I want to highlight that, worldwide, we have yet to experience a decrease in methane emissions from agriculture and food systems, and the figure below shows how relevant that is.

<br>
<br>
Finally, let us see how much these emissions vary, worldwide. Here is a summary of per capita emissions per country, divided by land use (LULUCF), production, and post production. Can you guess which developed country is constantly on the top right, with very high per capita emissions? This figure is here to suggest that there is much heterogeneity in terms of emissions across the globe. Part of it is diet-dependent, but trade can really play a huge role, as well: that bad performer on the right, Australia, is an example in that sense.

Now, the problems that I want to highlight are two. First, reducing carbon dioxide look rather feasible: decarbonizing the energy sector would contribute to reduce the CO₂ of all sectors without the need of very strong interventions. Interventions on land use can have a very significant impact on these emissions, and examples like Brazil are quite indicative. These interventions are going to happen, and are going to be favored if mechanisms like carbon offsetting are applied. Second, reducing methane (and nitrogen too, but that is a topic I would rather discuss separately) appears much, much harder. First of all, production is not likely going to change anytime soon. And, while livestock is considered the main culprit (and rightly so), rice cultivation contributes to a significant amount of methane emissions. And, as many countries' economies "develop" (or westernize, meaning that food is less often bought and/or consumed directly from the producers), more of it will end up being produced in the waste stage.
So, where do I want to get with these observations?
I will be very short, as soon I will directly link to the article. If we look at the long run, as we did in this analysis, the impact of methane on warming appears a concerning matter. If we look at the short run, using another metric (GWP20 instead of GWP100, which means considering the warming effects in the next 20 years), the urgency of the situation appears even worse, as per figure below. However, considering the very limited effort in reducing methane emissions from the food system so far (especially with respect to the reductions achieved from afforestation and reduced deforestation), and considering how fast a reduction in methane would translate in temperature adjustments, this is actually a critical area of improvement. Considering the last estimates of reaching 1.5 degrees of warming by 2027, we may be late for decarbonization, but still on time for demethanization.
